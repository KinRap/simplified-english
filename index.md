# “*Happily ever after*” with Unresponsive SME <!-- omit in toc -->


Have you ever asked your spouse to take out the trash? Or wash the dishes? Or buy the milk? How often did they not do it?

##It’s not like they don’t know how to do it, or what you’re asking for, or why      these matter to you. They just ignore your request - intentionally or not. 

That’s what communication with your Subject Matter Expert (SME) can look like. Especially unresponsive SME. But you can also get on like a house on fire. It's essential to find constructive ways to address the situation and create a lasting relationship, full of understanding and positive communication. Here are some suggestions on how. 

## *We all have ten fingers* – getting to know each other.

In any relationship, it is important to understand and be understood by your partner. Similarly, to have effective cooperation with your SME, it is essential to establish a mutual understanding. Learn about the SME's background, expertise, and contributions. Familiarize yourself with their work, publications, or any relevant projects they have been involved in. Get to know them better. Find common ground and engage in small talk. Show genuine interest in your SME's work and appreciate their contributions. Developing trust and rapport can make them more willing to share their knowledge and expertise with you. Trust means that you are a team and that both parties consider each other's needs and interests. 

## *The clock is ticking*.

In their busy lives, many couples do not have time to talk face-to-face. That’s why they have to find the best way to communicate. It is similar with an SME. They are often busy and juggle multiple responsibilities, so their time is valuable. That’s why you should discuss with them the preferred method of communication. Tailoring your communication style can enhance the efficiency of the information-gathering process. First, choose communication channels that suit the preferences of yourself and the SME. This could include face-to-face meetings, emails, phone calls, discuss with them the preferred method of communication, or any collaboration tolls. Also, remember to respect SME’s time. Clearly communicate the time commitment required for their involvement and work around their schedule. 

## *Si vis pacem, para bellum* – be prepared.


In every relationship, some conversations are more important than others. Some of them require preparation, some of them don’t. But your SME’s time is money, so you need to be prepared. Always. By thoroughly preparing for your conversation with them, you increase the likelihood of obtaining valuable information and fostering a positive working relationship. Depending on the subject matter, there may be technical terms or industry-specific jargon. Familiarize yourself with these terms to facilitate a more meaningful and efficient conversation. Understand why you need to speak with the SME and what specific information or insights you are seeking. Develop a list of key questions you want to ask during the conversation. Make sure these questions align with your objectives and are designed to extract the information you need.

## “*Road to Success*”

Communication is undoubtedly one of the principles of a lasting relationship, but it is a two-way street. You need to be clear in your communication. Otherwise, you can be misunderstood. Your SME is not Bob Dylan who said, “Chaos is a friend of mine.” Often busy SMEs need concrete questions. That is why you need to be clear in your communication. 

When you send an e-mail or message, ensure your initial message is clear and concise. Specify the information you need, why it is crucial, and any deadlines associated with the request. If you are seeking information for documentation purposes, provide a structured outline or template. This makes it easier for SMEs to organize their thoughts, and ensures that you receive the information in a format that aligns with your needs. Reinforce the significance of their input. Clearly communicate how their expertise is vital to the success of the project or task. This may motivate them to prioritize your request. When requesting information, set clear and reasonable deadlines. This helps manage expectations and provides a timeframe for the SME to respond.

When SMEs find a moment for a conversation face-to-face, clearly define the purpose of your conversation. Structure your conversation in a logical and organized manner. Outline the main topics you want to cover and how they relate to each other. This will help you navigate the discussion smoothly. Ask open-ended questions. Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." Instead, frame questions that require thoughtful and comprehensive answers. Anticipate that the conversation may lead to follow-up questions. Be prepared to ask additional queries based on the information provided by the SME. You should stay open-minded and ready to adapt your questions or expectations based on the information they provide. Pay close attention to the SME's responses, ask clarifying questions when needed, and ensure that you fully understand the information they are sharing. Remember that good notes or records are the basis for your work. 

## *Savoir-Vivre*

No one wants to live with a person who does not respect us. That will end in a divorce. But you want to live with your SME happily ever after. That is why good manners are mandatory. Your smile can do wonders. Remember to maintain a professional and understanding tone throughout your interactions. Show appreciation for your SME's expertise and the time they dedicate to providing information. A simple ‘thank you” can go a long way in building a positive relationship in the future. Celebrate successful milestones and completed documentation projects. Recognizing and appreciating the collaborative effort fosters a positive working relationship.

## Error!

Patience is key to good relationships, but what should you do when your SME still doesn’t respond? You can’t take them to counseling. Remind them about your needs, and meanwhile, try to find some answers on your own. Have a look at existing documentation. Explore the possibility of involving an alternative contact within the organization. Ensure the alternative has the knowledge and authority to provide the necessary information. But when you leave no stone unturned and you still don’t have important information, you must involve the SME's supervisor or manager. Frame the conversation as seeking assistance in ensuring a smooth workflow.
